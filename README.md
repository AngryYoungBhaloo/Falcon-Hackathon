# Falcon-Hackathon
Submission for Falcon Hackathon

This is an attempt at creating a Continuously Learning LLM. 
The LLM stores all the data it is ever given in an external data source and then uses Knowledge Graph technique to continuously organise, summarise and prioritise data, leading to superior inference.
